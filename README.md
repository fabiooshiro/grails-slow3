Service Reload?

why not?

"there is an assumption in spring-loaded that grails.* (and groovy.*, etc.) packages are only used by the frameworks and not in user code, so they're not candidates for reloading. See https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-loaded/blob/master/springloaded/src/main/java/org/springsource/loaded/TypeRegistry.java#L78 for the various ignored packages."
